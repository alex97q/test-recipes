    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            I had these unforgettable pierogies on vacation and knew I had to try to recreate them at home. 
            This is an easy and quick shortcut method using frozen pierogies. It's a stylish appetizer for 
            a dinner party or for a fun gathering of friends.
        </p>    
        <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
        <ul>
            <p><strong>Carmelized Onions</strong></p>
            <li>2 sweet onions</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons avocado oil or canola oil</li>

            <p><strong>Pierogies</strong></p>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package frozen cheese and potato pierogies</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon avocado oil or canola oil</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Trim the ends of the onions, cut in half lengthwise, and peel. Thinly slice the halves vertically from top to bottom.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions to skillet, tossing until well coated. Stir until they start to soften, 
                then reduce heat to medium-low. Cook until onions start to brown, 15 to 20 minutes, stirring frequently. If they start to stick 
                to the skillet, add a little water.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat butter and oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, add pierogies in a single layer, and cook for about 
                16 minutes or according to package directions, flipping halfway through. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Transfer pierogies to a serving plate. Add a dollop of sour cream to each pierogi, top with caramelized onions and crumbled bacon. 
                Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and parsley, and serve with lemon wedges.</li>
        
        </ol>
